<p> This whole adventure started in 1995 on a family vacation when I met a Corgi. Loved the breed and did a ton of research. Finally bought a Corgi and named him L.B. We started obedience classes and then agility classes. Now many years later, my entire family enjoys the sport. We now have 4 Border Collies and 1 Corgi. We are looking at another Corgi at this time. We will see. </p>

        <h2>The catalyst</h2>
        <p>
          In August 1995 we were heading to Florida for a family vacation.  We stopped in Perrysburg, GA for the night.  The front desk let us know that most of the rooms were taken due to a dog show in the area. We ordered pizza and was sitting in our room eating with the door propped open.  In come a dog that we had never seen before.  Very nice and hansom little guy.  We looked out the door and saw a conversion van with the door open and a few other dogs that appeared to be the same breed as the one that just came into our room.  We also noticed that one of the cages were open.  We called the front desk and let them know and we continued to pet the dog to keep him comfortable.  After about 10 minutes or so a woman walked by and said that the dog looked just like hers.  We asked if the van was hers and it was, so this was her dog.  We started asking questions about the breed.  Turned out to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.  That is when Krista and I fell in love with the breed.  We knew that we would have one when we got our own place.

        <h2>Little Buddy aka L.B</h2>
        <p>It had taken us a little while to find breeders in the Ohio area and to select the one that we wanted to purchase our first family pet.  We found Dillon Kennels in Springfield, OH.  We went and looked at the litter of three and choose LB.  LB was born on July 11, 2000.  We had already done our research and knew that we were going to find a club to run agility with LB.</p>

        <h2>Training Begins</h2>
        <p>In May of 2003 LB and I started in the beginners obedience class at Gem City Dog Obedience Club.  We had to take two class of obedience before taking the agility classes but LB was a natural and we only completed one before moving to agility class.</p>

        <h2>First Agility Class</h2>
        <p>Gem City was offering a summer long three class series that LB and I signed up to take.  There were five instructors and maybe 10-15 students.  We made some life long friends in that class.  It was a great beginning for us.  Unfortunately, I got very busy at work and could not attend classes any longer in the second session and that is when Krista took over and continued LB’s training.  LB and Krista made a great team.  When work slowed down and I was able to start back in class with LB, it was not long until I realized that Krista and LB had made a great team and should be back together.  Krista resumed classes with LB and even started competing with him.</p>

After interviewing many different breeds and talking with many rescues, we rescued Mia.  Mia was our first Border Collie.  She has been a great addition to the family.</p>

We ran three runs and went 3 for 3 and earned his first agility title. </p>
