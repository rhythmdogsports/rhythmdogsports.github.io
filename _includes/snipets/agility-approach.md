  I started teach to help myself to better understand the behaviors of both the handler and the dogs. I felt that if I were able to help others that it too would help my handling and performance. The longer that I taught the better that is made me as a person. There are so many wonderful people in this sport with so much to offer. I continue to learn from each person I come in contact with and still 20+ years later enjoy the sport in general.

  One of the amazing moments that I think I enjoy most when teaching a handler and dog combo is to watch the "light bulb" moments with each of them when things really start to work the way they think it should work. A moment can be when the handler has the trust of the training while in the ring and sends the dog in one direction and heads to in another direction. You really have to watch the first time but it is magical to see the expression on the handlers face that it worked and they now trust the training they have worked so hard with their dog. So many of these moments really makes this sport so much fun to run and to watch.
