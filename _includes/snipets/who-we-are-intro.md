<p> This whole adventure started in 1995 on a family vacation when I met a Corgi. Loved the breed and did a ton of research. Finally bought a Corgi and named him L.B. We started obedience classes and then agility classes. Now many years later, my entire family enjoys the sport. We now have 4 Border Collies and 1 Corgi. We are looking at another Corgi at this time. We will see. </p>
