"Agile" is officially a buzz word, and everyone has their own variation of it. So, what do <i>we</i> mean when we say, "We're an agile shop!" Great question. We realize that we all start at an entry level at the beginning of a project, and we will only get smarter as it goes on. That's why we don't waste our time with "big design" up front, and value being able to pivot our approach as we move forward. Pretty smart, huh?
