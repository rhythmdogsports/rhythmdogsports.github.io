<p>
To be successful in your early training with the puppy/dog, we need to find its motivator. Each puppy/dog is unique and will have a different motivator. With some it can be food/treats, with others it can be a toy and yet others it can be just attention from you. Some it can be a combination and others it may take a while to find it.

Be prepared to learn about yourself and your companion while enjoying the sport of agility. It is a very fun journey if you allow it to be.
