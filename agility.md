  Example of treat/food motivation: Our Border Collie Kaci is highly treat/food motivated and I discovered that she will do anything for a cooked hot dog. Once I found this out, I would only use cooked hot dogs when we were learning something new. I did not want to give her so many that it wore off the effect of the motivation. If I need to go back and work on something that we are having issues with then I will bring the cooked hot dog back out. This allows me to get her undivided attention and she focuses on what I am teaching her.

  Example of toy motivation: Our Border Collie Reagan is highly ball focused. Anyone in the family can bring out a ball and he will stop eating to go play ball. With his focus on the ball I can teach him anything as his reward for doing what I want is for me to throw the ball. I get what I want and he gets what he wants. Makes training fun for both of us.

  Example of attention motivation: I would usually say that as motivators go that treats/food would be number 1 and toys/balls would be slightly behind in 2nd and then attention would be a distant 3rd. The longer I am in the sport and the more that I learn, I am finding out that attention is a must for all dogs. They work with us for the attention. Mia my first Border Collie would take the treat but wanted the attention more. Our Corgi Fred-D too is highly food motivated but wants the attention from me to run in the ring. His motivator changed based on his needs. Our newest Border Collie Betty is highly attention motivated. She want attention more than anything else at this stage in her life.
